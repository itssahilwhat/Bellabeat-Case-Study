## Step 1: Ask

Sršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. These questions will guide your analysis:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

You will produce a repo with the following deliverables:

1. A clear summary of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of your analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis

### Things to Consider:
- Define the problem you’re trying to solve
- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
- Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context

**Questions to ask yourself in this step:**

- What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
- Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?
